# My First Pygame

This is a very small starter Pygame project. It contains a single file `main.py` that opens a window with a green square you can move with arrow keys or WASD.

How to run:
1. Install Python 3.10+ (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - python -m venv venv
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the game:
   - python main.py
